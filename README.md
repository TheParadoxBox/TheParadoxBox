# TheParadoxBox
#### The latest and greatest software for managing your crippled programs!

Do you ever feel like your programs are riddled with bugs? **Good!** TheParadoxBox is here to serve you.

TheParadoxBox finds bugs in the software he likes, **and does absolutely nothing else!** No contributing, no ideas for fixes, no nothing. He justs minds his own business and plays Doom or something.

**Interested?** There's a download for the program in the aptly named repository. If you're actually in the repository and not on my profile, you're just one click away!

<!---
TheParadoxBox/TheParadoxBox is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
